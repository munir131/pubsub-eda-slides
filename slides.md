# What is Event-Driven Architecture?

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which components communicate through events.

**Key Characteristics**:  
- Loose coupling between services  
- High responsiveness  
- Real-time communication

**Common Use Cases**:  
- Payment processing  
- Real-time notifications  
- Microservices communication

# Benefits of EDA

**Scalability**  
Systems can easily scale by adding more consumers or producers.  

**Resilience**  
Events are persisted and can be retried in case of failures.  

**Flexibility**  
Components can be replaced or updated independently.

# Why Google Pub/Sub?

Google Pub/Sub is a fully managed messaging service that enables asynchronous communication.

**Key Features**:  
- **Reliability**: Durable message storage and guaranteed delivery.  
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of messages per second.  
- **Security**: Encrypted data and access control.

# Deep Dive into Google Pub/Sub

**Message Delivery Semantics**  

1. **At-least-once delivery**:  
   - Messages may be delivered multiple times to ensure reliability.  

2. **At-most-once delivery**:  
   - Messages are delivered only once, without retries.

# Code Example: Publish Message in Node.js

```ts {monaco-run}
async function publishMessage(message) {
  try {
    const messageId = await pubSubClient.topic(topicName).publishMessage({
      data: Buffer.from(message),
    });
    console.log(`Message published with ID: ${messageId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error publishing message: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `pubSubClient` with your credentials.  
- **Step 2**: Create or use an existing topic.  
- **Step 3**: Publish a message using `publishMessage`.

# Code Explanation: Laravel Example

Learn how to configure and use Google Pub/Sub in a Laravel application.

### Configuration

```php {monaco}
'pubsub' => [
    'driver' => 'pubsub',
    'queue' => 'test',
    'project_id' => env('PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID', 'pubsub-eda'),
    'retries' => 5,
    'request_timeout' => 60,
    'keyFilePath' => env('PUBSUB_KEY_FILE', storage_path('pubsub-eda.json')),
    // Subscriber will be key and publisher will be value here
    'subscribers' => [
        'test-sub' => 'test'
    ],
    'plain_handlers' => [
        'plain_sub' => App\Jobs\PlainClass::class // This one for non-Laravel format messages
    ],
],
```

## Dispatching Jobs

```php {monaco}
dispatch(new ProcessMessage($message))
    ->onQueue('test')
    ->onConnection('pubsub');
```

/* Style to make code blocks full-width */
pre {
  width: 100% !important;
  text-align: left;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
</style>

# Practical Example: Pub/Sub Workflow

- **Producer**: Sends messages to a Pub/Sub topic.
- **Topic**: Acts as a messaging hub.  
- **Subscriber**: Receives and processes the messages.

---

# Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms

- Configure **retry policies** to handle transient errors.
- Use **dead-letter topics** for undeliverable messages.
- Monitor message flow using Google Cloud's **Stackdriver**.
